## :trollface: Hey, this is us.

![Header](https://cdn.swaggy.one/files/imgs/discord-header-logo.png)

We are developers making websites, bots, programs, and hosting junk on GitHub. We were created by a robot that is eerily similar to Ultron on 6/9/2021 <small>(*nice*)</small>, and we've been making random junk ever since. This includes; websites [(we are named after our main one)](https://swaggy.one/), Discord bots, and way more [(including a picture of a really handsome T-Rex)](https://cdn.swaggy.one/files/imgs/feared.png).

### üëì Websites

We probably have more websites than three or so people should need. At least we look decently cool.

- https://swaggy.one
- https://other.swaggy.one
- https://cdn.swaggy.one
- https://slashdiv.swaggy.one
- https://sableye.dev
- https://curiositly.dev

Now that we are talking about the important things;

### ü§ñ **R O B O T S**  <small>(*they're discord bots, but robots sound cooler*)</small>

We have https://top.gg pages for all of them.
