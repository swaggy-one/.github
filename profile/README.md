## Hey, this is us ðŸ‘‹

![pog](https://cdn.swaggy.one/files/imgs/discord-header-logo.png)

We are building developers making websites, bots, programs, and hosting junk on GitHub. swaggy.one has existed since 6/9/2021 <small>*nice*</small>. After we were created by a robot that is eerily similar to Ultron, we've been making random junk, [websites (we are named after our main one)](https://swaggy.one/), Discord bots, and way more (including a picture of a really handsome T-Rex)

### ðŸ‘“ Websites

We probably have more websites than three or so people should need. At least we look decently cool.

- https://swaggy.one
- https://other.swaggy.one
- https://cdn.swaggy.one
- https://slashdiv.swaggy.one
- https://sableye.dev
- https://curiositly.dev

Now that we are talking about the important things;

### ðŸ¤– **R O B O T S**  <small>(*they're discord bots, but robots sound cooler*)</small>

We have https://top.gg pages for all of them.

- [sableye](https://top.gg/bot/) - A multipurpose Discord bot
- [Walter Clements](https://top.gg/bot/877271681457082438) - he says walter
